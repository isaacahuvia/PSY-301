## Variables

-   Dependent variable (a.k.a. $DV$, a.k.a. $Y$): The variable that *depends on* the independent variable

-   Independent variable (a.k.a. $IV$, a.k.a. $X$): The variable whose variation we're interested in

-   E.g., Does depression symptom severity (DV) *depend on* gender (IV)?

-   E.g., Do grades (DV) *depend on* depression symptom severity (IV)?

## Testing Relationships

-   Correlation: Testing the relationship between two continuous variables

-   Linear regression: Testing the relationship between a continuous dependent variable and any kind of independent variable(s)

-   Logistic regression: Testing the relationship between a dichotomous dependent variable and any kind of independent variable(s)

## Getting Started

```{r}
#| echo: true
# Load packages
library(tidyverse)
library(here)

# Load data
hms_data <- readRDS(here("Healthy Minds Study", "Clean Data.rds"))

# Clean data
clean_data <- hms_data %>%
  drop_na()

# Describe data
str(clean_data)
```
